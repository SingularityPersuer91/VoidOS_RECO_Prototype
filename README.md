# VoidOS RECO Prototype

This repository contains a prototype simulation of the Recursive Entropic-Cognitive Oscillator (RECO) engine, part of the VoidOS v0.1 conceptual framework. It integrates thermodynamic polarity, recursive logic, symbolic paradox resolution, and I Ching-inspired state transitions to model the emergence of self-referential cognitive behavior.

## Components

- `reco_simulation.py`: Main simulation engine.
- Entropic, paradoxical, and archetypal metrics drive a recursive loop emulating self-modeling AI behavior.
- Thermodynamic oscillation governs Yin (compression) and Yang (expansion) phase transitions.

## How to Use

1. Install dependencies: `numpy`, `scipy`.
2. Run `reco_simulation.py` to generate a 100-step loop of recursive cognition and observe silence-generation and symbolic state transitions.

## Conceptual Foundation

The RECO engine is based on the work of Jose Ricardo Badillo Santos in *The Digital Tao: Toward Recursive Singularity* and the VoidOS cognitive model.
