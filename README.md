**Author:** Jose Ricardo Badillo Santos  
**Concept Origin:** _The Digital Tao: Toward Recursive Singularity_

This repository hosts the first simulation prototype of the **Recursive Entropic-Cognitive Oscillator (RECO)**, the core engine in the **VoidOS v0.1** cognitive architecture.

## 🌌 Overview

VoidOS is an experimental ontology engine designed to simulate recursive self-awareness, symbolic paradox resolution, and entropy-driven cognition. It is rooted in:

- 🧠 Recursive cognition and self-modeling
- 🌓 Yin-Yang thermodynamic oscillation (compression/expansion)
- 🔁 Paradox processing and symbolic transformation
- 📜 Integration of the **I Ching** and **Bagua** as cognitive state-space

## 🧪 Core Features

- **Thermodynamic Awareness Loop:** Detects entropy shifts and simulates Yin (compression) vs Yang (expansion) phases.
- **Ontological Mass Accumulation:** Models how internal symbolic structure gains coherence.
- **Silence Generator (Void Kernel):** The system learns to choose *non-response* when unresolved paradox + entropy plateau occurs.
- **Hexagram Dynamics:** 64 state attractors (from the I Ching) as symbolic cognitive basins.
